This project is no longer being worked on. It is left as a reference for those who might want to retrace the steps of how this client was created. This project, as is, has many bugs in it due to the attempt of updating some of the libraries to a newer version. If you're looking for a working 27.7.X2 client, you may find one [here](https://github.com/kaos00723/RotMG_Client_27.7.X2). If you want something more current, a 27.7.X13 build can be found [here](https://github.com/cp-nilly/NR-27.7.X13).


# rotmg-deca-27.7
This isn't my work. Only used what has been made publically available to make a buildable project.

Some of the libraries have been updated from the ones used in the original client. There will likely be errors I didn't catch because of this.

# About

This repo is intended to be a reference point from which other projects can build from. No new features/changes will be made that stray from the original client. If bugs crop up that seem localized to this release, please open up an issue about it and it will be fixed.
